## Hi there 👋


For years I have published stuff under my personal account or through various orgs. I feel that now is the right time to start building my own castle.

The software you find here will be things I have some stake in; either I talk about it, write about it, or perhaps even sell something that it goes with.

You are welcome to submit code, but please pay attention to the licencing on each repo as they may differ.

Documentation will be coming soon and will be linked here.

Fun fact: I have crewed for various bands including pet shop boys, cheeky girls and bowling for soup.
